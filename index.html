				<h1>What is cervical fluid?</h1>
				<p class="skinny">Cervical fluid, often called cervical mucus, is a healthy secretion produced by your cervix beginning at puberty. Regular cervical fluid self exams are an important way to keep tabs on your reproductive health and can even help you prevent pregnancy or get pregnant. Believe it or not, you already interact with this fluid every day when you wipe! But where does it come from?</p>

					<p class="skinny">Have you ever noticed dried stains or liquid in your undewear? Or a slick feeling when you wipe? That&rsquo;s cervical fluid!</p>
					<p class="skinny">It undergoes noticeable changes throughout your menstrual cycle&mdash;including changes in the way it looks and feels&mdash;in response to the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone.</p>
					<p class="skinny">Each woman&rsquo;s cervical fluid will follow a unique pattern throughout the menstrual cycle, and this pattern can reveal a great deal about your reproductive health. Next up, you&rsquo;ll learn how and why your body produces this special fluid.</p>

					<h2>The follicular phase</h2>
					<div id="hormoneChartImage2">
						<img class="responsiveChart" src="/what-is-cervical-fluid/img/hormoneChartImage2.png" />
					</div>
					<p class="skinny">The first half of your menstrual cycle is called the follicular phase, and it is primarily governed by the sex hormone <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen">estrogen</a>. All of your eggs are housed in tiny sacs called <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle">ovarian follicles</a>, which are located inside your <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary">ovaries</a>. Every menstrual cycle, in the weeks before ovulation, several of these ovarian follicles with begin to mature.</p>
					<p class="skinny">As these ovarian follicles grow and develop, they produce the hormone estrogen. This estrogen triggers your cervix to produce cervical fluid, which usually starts out thick and sticky. As ovulation gets closer, your follicles produce increasing amounts of estrogen (as shown in the chart), which causes your cervical fluid to become wet and slippery.</p>

					<h2>Ovulation</h2>
					<div id="hormoneChartImage3">
						<img class="responsiveChart" src="/what-is-cervical-fluid/img/hormoneChartImage3.png" />
					</div>
					<p class="skinny">A few days before you ovulate, your cervical fluid will be wet and slippery. This wet, slippery fluid may be very stretchy or thin and watery. You may even feel leaky or notice a slickness when you wipe after using the bathroom. This slippery cervical fluid mimics seminal fluid and is extremely hospitable to sperm. This slippery fluid helps sperm reach your egg, so unprotected sex is much more likely to result in a pregnancy when it is present.</p>
					<p class="skinny">During ovulation, your body releases a matured egg, or an ovum. Even though <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="http://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/fertility-window/">an ovum will only live for 12 to 24 hours after ovulation</a>, slippery cervical fluid helps sperm reach it before it dies. Even if ovulation hasn&rsquo;t occurred, <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/getting-pregnant/expert-answers/pregnancy/faq-20058504">sperm can live in cervical fluid for several days</a> waiting for an egg to be released.</p>

					<h2>The luteal phase</h2>
					<div id="hormoneChartImage4">
						<img class="responsiveChart" src="/what-is-cervical-fluid/img/hormoneChartImage4.png" />
					</div>
					<p class="skinny">The second half of your menstrual cycle is called the luteal phase, and is governed primarily by the hormone <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone">progesterone</a>. After you ovulate, the empty ovarian follicle that released the ovum will take on a new role.</p>
					<p class="skinny">The empty follicle becomes a structure called the <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_luteum">corpus luteum</a>, which produces the hormone progesterone. Progesterone dries up slippery cervical fluid and <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/292193-effects-of-progesterone-on-the-uterine-lining/">thickens the lining of the uterus</a> in case the ovum is fertilized and a pregnancy occurs.</p>
					<p class="skinny">Your cervical fluid may be sticky or creamy after ovulation, but it will no longer be wet and slippery.</p>
