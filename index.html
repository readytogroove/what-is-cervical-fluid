				<h1>What is cervical fluid?</h1>
				<p class="skinny">Cervical fluid, often called cervical mucus, is a healthy secretion produced by your cervix beginning at puberty. Regular cervical fluid self exams are an important way to keep tabs on your reproductive health and can even help you prevent pregnancy or get pregnant. Believe it or not, you already interact with this fluid every day when you wipe! But where does it come from?</p>

					<p class="skinny">Have you ever noticed dried stains or liquid in your undewear? Or a slick feeling when you wipe? That&rsquo;s cervical fluid!</p>
					<p class="skinny">It undergoes noticeable changes throughout your menstrual cycle&mdash;including changes in both its look and feel&mdash;in response to the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone.</p>
					<p class="skinny">Every cervical fluid pattern is unique, and it will even be different from cycle to cycle among individuals. Next up, you&rsquo;ll learn how and why your body produces this fluid.</p>

					</div>
					<p class="skinny">The first half of your menstrual cycle, or the follicular phase, is governed by the hormone estrogen. Several ovarian follicles&mdash;or tiny sacs in your ovaries that each house an immature egg&mdash;develop in the weeks before ovulation.</p>
					<p class="skinny">As your follicles develop, they produce estrogen. This triggers your cervix to produce cervical fluid, which may appear sticky or creamy at first. As ovulation gets closer, your follicles produce increasing amounts of estrogen, which causes your cervical fluid to become wet and slippery.</p>

					<div id="hormoneChartImage3">
						<img class="responsiveChart" src="/what-is-cervical-fluid/img/hormoneChartImage3.png" />
					</div>
					<p class="skinny">A few days before you ovulate, your cervical fluid will become wet and slippery. It may also be stretchy or thin and watery. You might even feel leaky and notice it in your underwear or when you wipe. This slippery cervical fluid is very hospitable to sperm and indicates that you are highly fertile.</p>
					<p class="skinny">During ovulation, your body releases a matured egg, or an ovum. An ovum will only live for 12 to 24 hours after ovulation. but slippery cervical fluid helps sperm reach it before it dies. Sperm can also live in cervical fluid for several days waiting for ovulation.</p>

					<h2>The luteal phase</h2>
					<div id="hormoneChartImage4">
						<img class="responsiveChart" src="/what-is-cervical-fluid/img/hormoneChartImage4.png" />
					</div>
					<p class="skinny">The second half of your menstrual cycle, or the luteal phase, is governed mainly by the hormone progesterone. After you ovulate, the sac that released the ovum will take on a brand new role.</p>
					<p class="skinny">It becomes a structure called the corpus luteum, which produces the hormone progesterone. This hormone dries up your cervical fluid and thickens the lining of your uterus in case the ovum is fertilized.</p>
					<p class="skinny">Your cervical fluid may be sticky or creamy after ovulation, but it will no longer be wet and slippery.</p>
