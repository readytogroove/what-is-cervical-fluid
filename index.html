				<h1>What is cervical fluid?</h1>
				<p class="skinny">Cervical fluid, often called cervical mucus, is a natural, healthy secretion produced by the cervix beginning at puberty. Regular cervical fluid self exams have some amazing health benefits&mdash;including preventative care, natural pregnancy prevention, and pregnancy assistance. But first, where does it come from?</p>

						<img class="responsiveChart" src="/what-is-cervical-fluid/img/hormoneChartImage1.png" />
					</div>
					<p class="skinny">Cervical fluid undergoes noticeable changes throughout the menstrual cycle&mdash;including changes in both its look and feel&mdash;in response to the hormones estrogen and progesterone.</p>
					<p class="skinny">Every woman&rsquo;s cervical fluid pattern is unique, and it will even be different from cycle to cycle. Next up, you&rsquo;ll learn how these changes occur.</p>

					<h2>The follicular phase</h2>
					<div id="hormoneChartImage2">
						<img class="responsiveChart" src="/what-is-cervical-fluid/img/hormoneChartImage2.png" />
					</div>
					<p class="skinny">The first half of the menstrual cycle, or the follicular phase, is governed by the hormone estrogen. Several ovarian follicles&mdash;or tiny sacs inside the ovaries that each house an immature egg&mdash;develop in the weeks before ovulation.</p>
					<p class="skinny">As the follicles develop, they produce estrogen, which triggers the cervix to produce cervical fluid. This estrogen production increases as ovulation approaches, causing cervical fluid to develop and become progressively wetter and more slippery.</p>

					<h2>Ovulation</h2>
					<div id="hormoneChartImage3">
						<img class="responsiveChart" src="/what-is-cervical-fluid/img/hormoneChartImage3.png" />
					</div>
					<p class="skinny">Just before ovulation, cervical fluid will typically be very slippery and additionally may be very stretchy or thin and watery. This slippery cervical fluid, which may resemble raw egg white, is particularly friendly to sperm and indicates that you are highly fertile.</p>
					<p class="skinny">During ovulation, one or two ovarian follicles will release a matured egg. An ovulated egg will only live for 12 to 24 hours, but sperm can survive inside the female body for many days when cervical fluid is present.</p>

					<h2>The luteal phase</h2>
					<div id="hormoneChartImage4">
						<img class="responsiveChart" src="/what-is-cervical-fluid/img/hormoneChartImage4.png" />
					</div>
					<p class="skinny">The second half of the menstrual cycle, or the luteal phase, is governed mainly by progesterone. After ovulation, the ovarian follicle&mdash;or sac that housed the egg before it was released&mdash;will take on a brand new role.</p>
					<p class="skinny">It becomes a structure called the corpus luteum, which produces the hormone progesterone. This progesterone dries up fertile cervical fluid and prepares the uterus for a possible pregnancy.</p>
					<p class="skinny">Cervical fluid may be sticky or creamy after ovulation, but it will no longer be wet and slippery.</p>

				<h1>Preventative care</h1>
				<p class="skinny">Becoming familiar with your unique cervical fluid pattern can help you uncover reproductive issues that may require a visit to your doctor.

Daily cervical fluid self exams help you pinpoint the most fertile days of your cycle, maximizing your chances of conceiving quickly. Familiarity with your fluid can even guide you and your doctor in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility.</p>

				<h1>Preventing pregnancy</h1>
				<p class="skinny">The ability to distinguish fertile cervical fluid can help you prevent pregnancy without the use of hormones. Fertility awareness&dash;based methods, such as the sympto&dash;thermal method (STM), <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/5/1310.full">rival hormonal contraceptives in effectiveness</a> when practiced properly and consistently. STM, unlike methods such as the rhythm method, helps users accurately pinpoint their fertile days and is backed by reproductive science. <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-info/birth-control/fertility-awareness">Learn more about STM</a>.</p>
